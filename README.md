Hey there, welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 repository! If you need any help solving the daily tasks for this years Advent of Code, feel free to look at my solutions below!

I did not 100% optimize any of my solutions as I just focus on solving them in not the worst way to not only have less pressure on myself to focus too much on these little problems, to have more fun, and to give a more approachable solution.

## 📁 Structure

---

Each day's puzzle solution is organized as follows:

```
Day[Number]
│
├── src
│   └── [Class Files]
└── [Other input files]
```

## 🖥️ How to Use

---

To run a solution, navigate to the corresponding day's directory and execute the Main class within the `src` folder.

I am only using base Java 21 so you do not have to install any dependencies.
